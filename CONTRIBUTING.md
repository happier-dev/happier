# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute.

## Where to open pull requests

Please open pull requests against `dev` (not `main`).

- `dev` is the integration branch where changes land first.
- `main` is the stable/release branch.

## Typical workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `dev`.
2. Commit your changes.
3. Open a PR targeting `dev`.
4. Address review feedback and iterate until merged.

## Release process

Maintainers release by promoting `dev` → `main` and deploying from there.

See `docs/release-process.md` for the high-level release flow.
