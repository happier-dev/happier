# Compatibility and version skew

This document defines when Happier preserves old behavior across UI, CLI, daemon, server, installers, and persisted state. The goal is safe upgrades and mixed-version operation without turning undeployed implementation history into permanent compatibility debt.

## Trigger

Apply this policy when a change affects a cross-component wire shape or semantic, persisted/session/settings data, schema or migration, feature/capability negotiation, installer or service state, upgrade/coexistence, or rollback. Routine internal refactors that leave these seams unchanged do not need a compatibility matrix or shim.

## Baseline classes

### Hard released obligations

- Active stable and preview releases count because both can exist on user machines or deployed infrastructure.
- Resolve each component independently. UI, CLI/daemon, server, desktop/mobile, and stack tags may point to different commits.
- Discover the current channel through rolling tags such as `cli-preview`, then record the immutable component version tag, commit, and relevant artifact/deploy evidence used by the check.
- Older releases count only when explicitly supported by policy or task scope; tag existence alone does not imply indefinite support.

### Moving `remote-dev` predecessor frontier

- `../remote-dev` is expected to ship before this repository. Its real current on-disk code is a prospective compatibility input even when it is uncommitted or not yet released.
- Inspect committed, staged, and unstaged code in the relevant paths. Record `HEAD`, working-tree status, the relevant diff/basis, and what was directly observed versus inferred.
- Never modify or clean the sibling worktree. Dirty changes may be incomplete or concurrently owned; if the externally observable contract is contradictory or unknowable, report that uncertainty rather than inventing multiple speculative adapters.
- Track the latest observable prospective shape, not every superseded internal implementation. When the sibling evolves before deployment, refresh the comparison and remove support that existed only for a replaced, never-released intermediary shape.
- Recheck relevant sibling paths before handoff when they were dirty or advanced during the task. Released stable/preview shapes remain hard obligations regardless of later sibling changes.

### Non-obligations

- `dev`/`*-dev.*` builds, untagged history outside the live predecessor frontier, abandoned experiments, and undeployed internal module paths are not lasting compatibility contracts.
- Do not keep aliases or adapters solely for an atomic internal rename/move whose old path never shipped.
- The predecessor rule preserves observable wire/data/state behavior, not `remote-dev`'s internal architecture.

## Map the seam

For the changed concept, identify:

- the canonical domain owner;
- every producer, consumer, reader, writer, serializer, parser, and persisted artifact;
- the old/new component versions that can actually meet during rollout or rollback;
- the wire, semantic, persistence, and operational expectations at that seam;
- any existing split-brain, duplicate decision path, fallback, or compatibility adapter in the touched corridor.

An existing same-concept split-brain in the touched corridor must be consolidated at the canonical owner. A compatibility adapter may translate released or predecessor shapes, but it must not independently decide domain behavior.

## Direction and rollout

- New readers accept supported old shapes; new writes use the canonical current shape.
- Old readers need to accept new writes only when coexistence, independent component rollout, or rollback makes that direction reachable.
- New clients talking to old servers must capability-negotiate or degrade safely instead of assuming the new contract.
- Old clients talking to new servers retain released behavior for ordinary compatible changes and for every operation the new server can still execute safely. A major incompatible server change may require a newer client for the affected operation, but that support boundary is an explicit developer/product decision—not an agent-selected default.
- Persisted-state changes consider both old-writer → new-reader and, when rollback/coexistence is supported, new-writer → old-reader.
- Prefer operation-scoped graceful degradation over connection-wide rejection: admit the old client, keep unaffected reads and writes available, and return a typed upgrade requirement only when the requested operation cannot be performed safely. Reject the whole connection only when no authenticated operation can be made safe. `agent-transition.md` is the current worked example: an old daemon answers `session.agentTransition` with `RPC_METHOD_NOT_AVAILABLE`, the client maps that one code to a no-effect operation-scoped rejection, every other transport failure maps to an indeterminate outcome rather than a false "nothing happened", and Machine presence — not the error — decides whether the reader is told to update the CLI or that the machine is offline.
- For an incompatible transition, prefer prepare/expand → activate/migrate → contract when mixed-version coexistence or rollback is an approved requirement. Do not assume that old clients must read new writes merely because the server is self-hosted.

Before adding dual writers, parallel persisted formats, rollout modes, operator flags, socket-drain protocols, or a mandatory client floor, compare their lifetime cost with the actual user behavior required. If preserving old-client/new-server behavior for a major change would require substantial machinery, stop and obtain an explicit developer/product decision among: operation-scoped degradation, a documented client update requirement, or the heavier compatibility transition. An agent must not silently choose either forced upgrades or heavy compatibility machinery. This exception is for genuinely incompatible, high-cost transitions; routine server changes must remain compatible and must not manufacture client-update requirements.

### Self-hosted relay release checks

The public release profiles treat self-hosted relay upgrades as independent
component upgrades, not as a fleet migration protocol. For a stable release,
prioritize these directions:

- current UI, CLI, and daemon core flows against a supported older
  self-hosted relay;
- bounded core flows from a supported older client or daemon to the current
  relay, preserving unaffected operations and returning a typed update
  requirement only for an unsafe operation;
- persisted state written by the supported prior release read by current
  readers; and
- current-writer to supported old-reader only when rollback or coexistence
  can actually make that direction reachable.

The release agent derives the affected, reachable directions from the actual
diff and supported released baselines while it performs the initial release
inspection, before release-note/version materialization or a release commit.
That single inspection also owns the public-note proposal and validation
selection. After materialization, the agent only confirms that the final delta
contains the approved release inputs and no unexpected runtime-reachable
change; a full second analysis is required only when the source contract
changed. Exact scripts can prove named behaviors
against named artifacts—for example the published-server-v0.2.1 pending-queue
regressions or a `docker-release-assets` published-channel → local-build
upgrade—but none of them issues a general compatibility verdict. The Docker
upgrade suite runs in a normal profile only when the diff affects relay
storage/schema, startup/runtime dependencies, authentication persistence,
encryption storage, or upgrade behavior, the release changes the server, and a
supported published relay predecessor exists. A server version change alone is
insufficient. Broader installer, platform, and
historical-version exploration remains risk-selected deep certification.
Release orchestration does not wait for every
self-hosted process, impose a mandatory client floor, orchestrate a database
migration, or coordinate a global cutover.
If a concrete migration has a writer-drain or maintenance-window requirement,
its dedicated migration procedure owns that external operation.

### Session draft rollout

Synchronized Session drafts are negotiated through the `sessions.drafts` server feature bit. A new
client fails closed when that bit or the typed routes are unavailable and retains the incumbent
local-only behavior; it does not send draft records through generic Account KV routes. A capable
server reserves the draft KV prefix so old generic-KV clients cannot read or overwrite typed draft
rows.

The first capable client imports the retired local existing-Session text/semantic stores and the
singleton new-Session draft into the canonical draft repository. It removes each legacy value only
after the corresponding canonical record is durably acknowledged, so an interrupted import remains
recoverable. The legacy readers are migration adapters, not parallel writers, and may be removed
when supported persisted local state no longer requires them.

Draft documents preserve bounded unknown extension fields as JSON. This lets a client without a
newer composer contribution edit fields it understands without deleting newer semantic data; it
does not authorize that client to execute the unknown contribution. Raw generic-file bytes, local
file handles and URIs, credentials, secret values, and local presentation state remain outside the
compatibility shape. Plugin semantic attachments, mentions, fallback presentation, and opaque
execution-target-bound staged-media handles may round-trip; execution still fails closed when the
owning plugin or target is unavailable.

## SDK protocol evolution

A wire epoch describes compatible semantics, not an exact property census. Every
material object boundary, including nested objects, is classified explicitly as
`closed`, `additive-open/drop`, or `additive-open/preserve`; a parent policy
never silently classifies its children.

- **`closed`** rejects unknown properties. It is mandatory for identities,
  qualified references, Account or credential selection, permissions, routing,
  mutation inputs/outcomes, authoritative lifecycle facts, executable
  declarations, and runtime unions. Stable Host Events are always closed.
- **`additive-open/drop`** may accept bounded optional unknown properties only
  for transient, presentation, or read projections where an older consumer can
  safely ignore them. Normalization removes those properties.
- **`additive-open/preserve`** may retain bounded unknown properties only when
  the component is an explicit round-trip custodian for a persisted document or
  opaque provider configuration. Preserving data never grants identity,
  authority, routing, credential selection, persistence-policy, or trusted
  prompt/transcript/UI power.

Known fields remain strict under every policy: required fields stay required;
invalid values do not coerce; and owner-justified encoded-byte or semantic
cardinality bounds still apply where the actual wire, storage, or operation
contract requires them. Implementation safety guards such as serializer/parser
recursion depth are private fail-safe details, not public semantic JSON quotas.
An accepted unknown is data, not authority.

An optional input is compatible only when an older implementation can ignore it
without falsely reporting success. Otherwise advertise an optional
operation/capability or introduce a new wire epoch. Likewise, a new union member
is compatible only in an explicitly skippable, bounded presentation list.
Identity, presence, permission, pagination, retry, and mutation-outcome unions
need an existing safe `unknown` arm or a new epoch; they are not skippable by
default.

npm package versions and exported wire epochs evolve independently: a later npm
major may still export V1, and a later npm minor may make only V1-compatible
additions. A public cross-plugin business protocol is a separately publishable
`@happier-dev/<feature>-protocol` package with explicit `/v1` and
`/testing/v1` exports. It contains schemas, types, helpers, and conformance
fixtures only—not host runtime, persistence, provider implementation,
credential materialization, polling, or a private `@happier-dev/protocol`
dependency—and it has no `latest`, `current`, or `default` aliases. Compatible
package copies interoperate through serialized protocol identity/version and
runtime validation, never JavaScript object identity.

The package README and nearest `AGENTS.md` must name the feature's domain owner
and link here rather than copy this doctrine. New feature-protocol code must use
one synchronous executable validator/normalizer that derives its bounded public
JSON Schema; independently handwritten parser/schema pairs are not allowed.

The approved SDK r0.31 direct cut does not make current `dev` → `remote-dev`
rollback a supported direction. Do not add predecessor readers, dual writers,
aliases, writer-floor waits, or rollback-only gates for unpublished author
contracts; forward migration and current-version integrity still apply.

## Proportionate matrix

List all affected reachable directions and mark each `required`, `unreachable`, or `unsupported` with a reason. Direct seam tests cover each required direction. End-to-end rows are selected by risk and real deployment order.

Do not run a full Cartesian UI × CLI × daemon × server matrix for an internal or unrelated change. Require broader combinations when a shared protocol, persistence shape, installer/service state, or rollout ordering actually couples those roles.

## Evidence and tests

- Prefer real released/predecessor artifacts, serializers, clients, or provenance-pinned golden vectors.
- A fixture reconstructed from current types is not evidence that the released or predecessor reader/writer behaves that way.
- Use the smallest discriminating test for each material direction, then add risk-selected upgrade, coexistence, rollback, and state-continuity flows.
- Do not multiply shallow permutations. A new test must distinguish a plausible incompatibility, reader/writer mismatch, semantic change, or rollout failure.
- Record the exact tag/commit/artifact or sibling worktree basis, component roles, direction, command, and result.

## Compatibility path lifecycle

Every retained compatibility path records:

- the released or prospective source shape it supports;
- its producer and consumer;
- whether it exists for upgrade, coexistence, rollback, or persisted historical data;
- the canonical owner it delegates to;
- its removal condition.

Remove the path when its support window has ended and evidence shows no supported reader, writer, or stored shape still requires it. Do not remove a released-data reader merely because current writers stopped producing that shape.

## Migration history

Migration source has a stricter authoring boundary than ordinary internal code:

- A migration is **local-only** while it has not shipped in a supported stable or preview artifact. Local-only migrations may be edited, renamed, consolidated, or removed before publication.
- Once a migration ships in a supported stable or preview artifact, its name and bytes are immutable. Correct later behavior with a new append-only migration; do not rewrite, rename, or delete the released migration.
- Shared development branches and `*-dev.*` artifacts are evidence that a development database may need explicit reconciliation, but they do not create a lasting product compatibility obligation. Before the next supported release, their migration source may be corrected or consolidated in place when the final transition is still unreleased.

Before publishing a feature, consolidate local-only migration churn into the smallest clear transition from the published schema to the intended final schema. Do not retain add-then-drop columns, temporary tables, renamed draft identities, checksum aliases, or corrective migrations solely because a developer database applied an earlier draft. Retain multiple migrations only when each step serves a real rollout, backfill, transaction, provider, or mixed-version requirement.

If the deterministic repo-local development stack bound to the current checkout applied a local-only or development-exposed draft that is later rewritten, the database must be reconciled in place as part of the same implementation task:

1. resolve the current checkout's deterministic repo-local stack and verify its repository path and managed database ownership;
2. treat its database as retained, non-disposable development data—never delete, reset, recreate, replace, truncate, clean, or discard it;
3. do not ask for separate confirmation and do not create a backup, snapshot, or clone for this narrowly scoped repo-local reconciliation;
4. compare its actual data, complete physical schema, and migration ledger with the intended final schema;
5. quiesce only stack-owned writers when required, apply the exact provider-specific schema/data delta or canonical backfill transactionally, and update only the matching ledger record after the transition succeeds;
6. run the canonical migration deploy twice, then verify current source checksums, the ledger, provider integrity, and foreign keys;
7. restore the stack's prior running state when it was quiesced.

The migration edit and its repo-local reconciliation are one work unit owned by the last editor. Any later edit to the migration invalidates earlier checksum/ledger reconciliation evidence and requires the later editor to repeat reconciliation before handoff.

For `main`, shared, staging, production, external, another checkout's/named QA stack, or otherwise user-owned databases, prepare the provider-specific procedure, back up or snapshot when required, and obtain explicit approval before mutation. If stack identity or database ownership is ambiguous, fail closed without mutating any candidate.

That reconciliation is an operator/development action, not a shipped compatibility path. Do not add runtime checksum exceptions, migration-name aliases, duplicate no-op migrations, or automatic ledger repair merely to preserve unpublished development history.

Keep PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MySQL migrations aligned by intent. Before publication, validate both a clean migration from the published baseline and the executed repo-local reconciliation path when affected; use the approved reconciliation path for other retained databases. After publication, preserve the exact migration history and test upgrades append-only.
