# Release process

This repo uses a simple two-branch model:

- `dev` is the integration branch where changes land first.
- `main` is the stable/release branch.
- `deploy/**` branches are managed by automation for deployments (do not push to these manually).

## Contributing flow (recommended)

1. Create a feature branch from `dev`.
2. Open a pull request targeting `dev`.
3. After review, changes are merged into `dev`.

Notes:

- Maintainers may push directly to `dev` when needed (depending on branch rules).
- External contributors should assume **PRs must target `dev`**, not `main`.

## Release flow (maintainers)

When `dev` is stable and you want to ship:

1. Run the **RELEASE — Dev → Main** workflow.
2. The workflow runs the repo test suite and typecheck, builds the website/docs (if enabled), and runs a CLI smoke test (if enabled).
3. If checks pass, it promotes `dev` → `main` using a fast-forward (no merge commit). If `main` has diverged, it can optionally perform a guarded reset.
4. Optionally bumps versions on `main`, promotes deploy branches for the selected environment, and (optionally) publishes the CLI.

Deploy branches typically include `deploy/<env>/ui`, `deploy/<env>/server`, `deploy/<env>/website`, and `deploy/<env>/docs` (depending on what changed and which options you select).

## Deploy branches → production infrastructure

Pushes to `deploy/<env>/*` are intended to trigger deployment automation (for example, calling a protected deploy hook behind Cloudflare Access). How deployments are performed is intentionally decoupled from how code is promoted into deploy branches.

In this repo, the deploy hook is implemented by the **DEPLOY — Deploy Branch** workflow:

- Trigger: pushes to `deploy/<env>/<component>` (or a manual workflow dispatch).
- Action: sends `POST` requests to one or more configured deploy webhook URLs for that component.
- Auth: adds Cloudflare Access service-token headers (`CF-Access-Client-Id` / `CF-Access-Client-Secret`).
- Server deploy order: API first, then worker.

Configuration (recommended as GitHub *Environment* secrets/vars for `production` / `preview`):

- `CF_WEBHOOK_DEPLOY_CLIENT_ID`, `CF_WEBHOOK_DEPLOY_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_URL`: base URL (e.g. `https://ci.leecloud.ch/api/deploy/`)
- Newline-separated webhook URL lists:
  - `HAPPIER_UI_DEPLOY_WEBHOOKS`
  - `HAPPIER_WEBSITE_DEPLOY_WEBHOOKS`
  - `HAPPIER_DOCS_DEPLOY_WEBHOOKS`
  - `HAPPIER_SERVER_API_DEPLOY_WEBHOOKS`
  - `HAPPIER_SERVER_WORKER_DEPLOY_WEBHOOKS`
  - `HAPPIER_CLI_DEPLOY_WEBHOOKS`

The `HAPPIER_*_DEPLOY_WEBHOOKS` values can be either:
- webhook IDs (recommended), which will be called as `${DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_URL}/{id}`
- full `https://…` URLs (supported for backwards compatibility)

If you only need to move branches (no deploy/publish):

- Use **PROMOTE — Branch (fast-forward or reset)** to move `source` → `target` in a safe, explicit way.
- Use **PROMOTE — Main from Dev** as a shortcut wrapper for `dev` → `main`.

## Why fast-forward?

Fast-forwarding `main` to `dev` is the safest “no merge commit” promotion:

- It never rewrites history.
- It fails if branches diverged (so you can decide what to do next).

The reset option exists for rare cases where you intentionally want `main` to match `dev` exactly.

## Database migrations (server)

For the server, database migrations should be automated as part of the deployment runtime:

- Run `prisma migrate deploy` at container startup (entrypoint) or via an explicit platform “pre-deploy” hook.
- Running migrations from *both* API and worker is acceptable as long as you expect contention and handle it (Prisma uses a DB lock to serialize migrations; the non-holder should wait/retry).
- Avoid running migrations at image build-time (Dockerfile), since migrations require a live DB connection.
