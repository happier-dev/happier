## Recommended layout

We recommend separating your services/domains so you can deploy and scale them independently:

- `api.happier.dev` → server (HTTP API + Socket.IO)
- `app.happier.dev` → app web UI (static)
- `happier.dev` → marketing site (static)
- `docs.happier.dev` → docs site

This keeps the API scalable and lets you deploy UI/sites independently.

## Practical approach

- Run the API server behind a reverse proxy that handles TLS and routing.
- Serve the UI/website/docs as static sites (or via lightweight web servers) behind the same reverse proxy.
- Keep secrets in your deployment platform (env vars), not in git.
