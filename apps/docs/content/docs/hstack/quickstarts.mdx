title: Quickstarts
description: Common flows (feature work, PR testing, server changes) using stacks + worktrees.
---

This page is the “copy/paste” companion to `/docs/hstack/development`.

If you’re new, read `/docs/hstack/setup` and `/docs/hstack/worktrees-and-forks` first.

---

## 1) Typical feature work (recommended)

Create a worktree based on upstream (clean PR history):

```bash
hstack wt new my-feature --from=upstream --use
```

Create an isolated stack and pin it to the active worktree:

```bash
hstack stack new exp1
hstack stack wt exp1 -- use active
```

Run the stack in dev mode:

```bash
hstack stack dev exp1
```

Push the branch to your fork:

```bash
hstack wt push active --remote=origin
```

---

## 2) Use the canonical `dev/` checkout

If you’re working directly on the `dev` branch (common for maintainers):

```bash
hstack stack new dev
hstack stack wt dev -- use dev
hstack stack dev dev
```

---

## 3) Develop server changes (full server)

Create a full-server stack:

```bash
hstack stack new full1 --server=happier-server
```

Then run dev:

```bash
hstack stack dev full1
```

Notes:

- This uses Docker-managed Postgres/Redis/Minio for the stack.
- If you don’t want Docker-managed infra, configure `DATABASE_URL`/`REDIS_URL`/`S3_*` in the stack env file and re-run.

---

## 4) Test an upstream PR locally

Create a PR worktree:

```bash
hstack wt pr 123 --use
```

Create a PR stack that pins to it:

```bash
hstack stack pr pr123 --repo=123 --dev
```

If you have a `dev-auth` seed stack, you can seed and link/copy auth:

```bash
hstack stack pr pr123 --repo=123 --dev --seed-auth --copy-auth-from=dev-auth --link-auth
```

---

## 5) Port legacy split-repo commits into the monorepo

If you have changes that live in a legacy split-repo layout (old UI/CLI/server repos), use:

- `/docs/hstack/monorepo-port`

---

## 6) One-shot validation on a worktree

For quick checks against your current checkout (non-stack-scoped):

```bash
hstack typecheck all
hstack lint all
hstack test all
```

For stack-scoped validation (recommended when debugging runtime issues):

```bash
hstack stack typecheck exp1 all
hstack stack lint exp1 all
hstack stack test exp1 all
```
