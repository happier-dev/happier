## Inspect what hstack is actually using

```bash
hstack where
hstack where --json
```

Common follow-ups:

```bash
hstack stack info exp1
hstack stack info exp1 --json
```

---

## Inspect stack health

```bash
hstack stack doctor exp1
```

Logs:

```bash
hstack logs
hstack logs:tail
hstack stack service exp1 logs
hstack stack service exp1 tail
```

## High-signal env knobs

Paths:

- `HAPPIER_STACK_HOME_DIR`
- `HAPPIER_STACK_RUNTIME_DIR`
- `HAPPIER_STACK_WORKSPACE_DIR`
- `HAPPIER_STACK_REPO_DIR`
- `HAPPIER_STACK_CLI_ROOT_DIR`

Run behavior:

- `HAPPIER_STACK_NO_BROWSER=1`
- `HAPPIER_STACK_CLI_BUILD_MODE=auto|always|never`
- `HAPPIER_STACK_CLI_BUILD=0`

Auth seeding:

- `HAPPIER_STACK_AUTH_SEED_FROM=dev-auth`
- `HAPPIER_STACK_AUTO_AUTH_SEED=1`

See also `/docs/hstack/paths-and-env` for precedence and where env files live.
