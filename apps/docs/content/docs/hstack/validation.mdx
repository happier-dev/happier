title: Validation (typecheck, lint, test)
description: Run checks on the active checkout or stack-scoped (recommended).
---

Most hstack commands support `--help` and `--json`.

---

## Validate the active checkout (non-stack)

```bash
hstack typecheck all
hstack lint all
hstack test all
```

Target a specific area:

```bash
hstack typecheck ui
hstack typecheck cli
hstack typecheck server
```

---

## Validate inside a stack (recommended)

Stack-scoped validation applies that stack’s env (ports, server URLs, DB config, CLI home, etc).

```bash
hstack stack typecheck exp1 all
hstack stack lint exp1 all
hstack stack test exp1 all
```

Target a specific area:

```bash
hstack stack typecheck exp1 ui
hstack stack lint exp1 cli
hstack stack test exp1 server
```

---

## CI-oriented checks

hstack also provides a `ci` command for standardized runs:

```bash
hstack ci --help
```

Use this when you want a repeatable “policy” run (and to align with what maintainers will run).
