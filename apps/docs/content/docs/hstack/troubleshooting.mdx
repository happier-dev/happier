title: Troubleshooting
description: High-signal fixes for common local issues (auth, ports, wrong checkout, unhealthy stacks).
---

## “No machine” / auth required

Most “auth is broken” symptoms are one of:

- you opened the wrong stack URL (browser origin collision)
- the stack did not get seeded auth (non-main stacks)
- the stack is pointed at an unexpected repo checkout

Check:

```bash
hstack where
hstack stack info <stack>
```

Fix auth seeding:

```bash
hstack auth seed
hstack stack auth <stack> copy-from dev-auth
```

---

## “This stack is using the wrong checkout”

Check the pinned repo:

```bash
hstack stack info <stack>
cat ~/.happier/stacks/<stack>/env | rg HAPPIER_STACK_REPO_DIR
```

Repoint:

```bash
hstack stack wt <stack> -- use dev
# or:
hstack stack wt <stack> -- use pr/123-some-pr
```

---

## Port collisions

If hstack refuses to start because a pinned port is in use:

- stop the stack: `hstack stack stop <stack>`
- or unpin ports (then re-run start/dev):
  - use `hstack stack edit <stack> --interactive`, or
  - `hstack stack audit --fix-ports`

---

## Stack is unhealthy / can’t reach server

```bash
hstack stack doctor <stack>
hstack logs:tail
```

If you’re using full server (`happier-server`), verify Docker:

```bash
docker ps
```

---

## “I changed something but nothing updates”

In dev mode, prefer running with `--restart` at least once (so hstack owns the PIDs and can restart safely):

```bash
hstack stack dev <stack> -- --restart
```

If you’re running `hstack dev` outside stack mode, do:

```bash
hstack dev --restart
```
