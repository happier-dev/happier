title: hstack (Happier Stack)
description: Self-host, run, and develop Happier locally with stacks + worktrees.
---

`hstack` is the official local “stack orchestrator” for Happier. It’s designed for:

- self-hosting the full Happier stack on your machine
- running multiple isolated instances (“stacks”) in parallel
- developing Happier safely using git worktrees (clean PR history)
- contributor workflows (dev branch, fork PRs)
