title: Auth (dev-auth seeding)
description: Create a dev-auth seed stack once, then reuse it for new stacks without re-login.

## Why auth seeding exists

Most workflows are easier if you authenticate once and then reuse that identity across stacks:

- you don’t need to re-login every time you create a new stack
- PR stacks can be created/reused quickly (`hstack stack pr … --seed-auth`)

hstack’s recommended pattern is a dedicated seed stack called `dev-auth`.

Auth seeding is best-effort and intentionally does **not** copy entire databases between stacks; it focuses on:

- credentials/config files that the UI/CLI expect
- minimal DB rows when needed (so stacks start cleanly)

---

## Create the seed stack (recommended)

```bash
hstack auth seed
```

This runs the full guided flow to:

- create the `dev-auth` stack (as a fresh identity)
- guide you through UI login so the seed is immediately usable
- optionally persist defaults so future stacks can reuse it automatically

If you want a non-interactive run (for scripting), check:

```bash
hstack auth seed --help
```

---

## Make it the default seed (recommended)

If you want new stacks to auto-seed when they look uninitialized, set these in your home overrides:

- `HAPPIER_STACK_AUTH_SEED_FROM=dev-auth`
- `HAPPIER_STACK_AUTO_AUTH_SEED=1`

Typically these live in:

- `~/.happier-stack/env.local`

See `/docs/hstack/paths-and-env` for env file precedence.

---

## Use the seed for a specific stack

To seed auth into a stack:

```bash
hstack stack auth <stack> copy-from dev-auth
```

If you prefer to keep the credentials in sync (less isolation, more convenience), you can symlink auth files:

```bash
hstack stack auth <stack> copy-from dev-auth --link
```

Copy vs link:

- `copy` (default): more isolation, safer for tests
- `link`: more convenience (keeps credentials in sync), but stacks share auth state

---

## Seed many stacks at once

```bash
hstack auth copy-from dev-auth --all --except=main,dev-auth
```

For full-server stacks (`happier-server`), seeding may require Docker infra to be running.

---

## Store the UI dev key (optional)

Some UI automation flows need a local “dev key” stored on your machine:

```bash
hstack auth dev-key --set "<key>"
hstack auth dev-key --print
```

Tip: `--print` is what you want when logging in from the UI or handing a key to an agent.

Help:

```bash
hstack auth --help
```
