title: Setup
description: Install hstack, choose a workspace, and initialize main/dev checkouts.
---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Yarn
- Docker (recommended if you plan to use `happier-server` full flavor)
- Tailscale (optional, but recommended for phone/remote access)

## Install and initialize

hstack can be run either:

- as an installed CLI (recommended once published), or
- via `npx` (good for one-off setup), or
- from a local checkout (maintainers / when the npm package isn’t published yet).

### Guided setup (recommended)

Development profile (recommended for contributors):

```bash
hstack setup --profile=dev
```

Self-host profile (stable / production-ish):

```bash
hstack setup --profile=selfhost
```

### Choose a workspace directory

The workspace is where hstack stores:

- `main/` (stable checkout; treat as read-only)
- `dev/` (dev branch checkout for development)
- categorized worktrees:
  - `pr/…`
  - `local/<owner>/…`
  - `tmp/<owner>/…`

You can set it explicitly:

```bash
hstack setup --profile=dev --workspace-dir=~/Documents/Development/happier
```

Or by env var:

```bash
export HAPPIER_STACK_WORKSPACE_DIR=~/Documents/Development/happier
```

## Developing hstack itself (local CLI root)

When you’re iterating on the hstack source code inside the monorepo, you can point the installed shim at your local checkout:

```bash
export HAPPIER_STACK_CLI_ROOT_DIR=~/Documents/Development/happier/dev/apps/stack
hstack help
```

To confirm what hstack is actually using on your machine, run:

```bash
hstack where
```
