title: Encryption model
description: High-level overview of keys and encrypted payloads.

This doc is intentionally high-level:

- Clients generate keys locally.
- Encrypted payloads are uploaded and synced.
- Sharing requires distributing data keys to authorized users (still encrypted end-to-end).
