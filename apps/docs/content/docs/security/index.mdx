## End-to-end encryption (E2EE)

Messages and sensitive session payloads are encrypted on-device. The server stores encrypted blobs and sync metadata, but cannot read content.

## What the server can see

- Account identifiers and basic metadata needed to route sync.
- Encrypted blobs (ciphertext).
- Operational metadata for running the service (timestamps, sizes).
