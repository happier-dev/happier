description: Install, connect, and run Happier locally.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js + Yarn
- Docker (recommended for the **full** server flavor)

## Quickstart

1. Install the CLI (published to npm):

```bash
npm install -g @happier-dev/cli
```

2. Start the server locally (choose one):

- **full flavor** (Postgres + Redis + S3/Minio): run the server package in dev mode.
- **light flavor** (single-machine): run the light entrypoint.

3. Point the app/CLI to your server URL:

- App: set the “Custom server URL” setting.
- CLI: set the server URL env var (or use your stack wrapper if you have one).

## What’s next

- Read about **deployment** and domains: `/docs/deployment`.
- Learn the **architecture** and sync model: `/docs/architecture`.
