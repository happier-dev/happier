title: Architecture overview
description: How server, CLI, and app fit together.
---

## Components

- **Server**: stores encrypted payloads + sync metadata, provides HTTP API and realtime updates.
- **CLI**: runs local agents/LLMs, keeps sessions synced, talks to the server for multi-device.
- **App**: mobile/web UI for sessions and devices.

## Realtime vs HTTP

- Realtime (Socket.IO) is used for **push notifications** (“something changed”).
- HTTP is used for **authoritative reads/writes** and catch-up after disconnects.

## Multi-device reliability

Clients should be able to reconnect and reconcile:

- If a device missed realtime updates, it should fetch changes from the server and refresh state deterministically.
